This repository contains course work for a Computer Security course at Montana State University.

A significant portion of the course was taught using a hands-on virtual machine. The virtual machine was provided by Kevin Du (the author of the textbook that we used).
The code that we ran is in this repository but is likely only to work on that specific virtual machine (with intentional vulnerabilities) and with specific settings. Nevertheless, the code is provided for the benefit of anyone viewing this repository. In addition to the code, I was expected to write lab reports for each assignment. These are in each of the *lab\** directories and are given in a .tex and .pdf format. Anyone looking for an explanation of the lab should view those reports.
